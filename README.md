Laravel AWS Webhooks is an easy webhook handler for Laravel to catch AWS SNS notifications for various services in a more eloquent way.

Laravel AWS Webhooks leverages [renoki-co/laravel-sns-events](https://github.com/renoki-co/laravel-sns-events), a package that implements the basic functionalities of SNS HTTP/HTTPS requests, so that you can focus just on handing the event.
