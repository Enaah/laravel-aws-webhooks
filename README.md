Laravel AWS Webhooks is an easy webhook handler for Laravel to catch AWS SNS notifications for various services in a more eloquent way.

Laravel AWS Webhooks leverages [renoki-co/laravel-sns-events](https://github.com/renoki-co/laravel-sns-events), a package that implements the basic functionalities of SNS HTTP/HTTPS requests, so that you can focus just on handing the event.

## ü§ù Supporting

Renoki Co. loves building open source (and helpful) projects on Github for any developer to have an easier job at building products. üì¶ Developing and maintaining projects is a harsh job and tho, we love it.

If you are using your application in your day-to-day job, on presentation demos, hobby projects, or even school projects, spread some kind words about our work or sponsor our work.

_Kind words will touch our chakras and vibe, while the sponsorships will keep the open-source projects alive._
